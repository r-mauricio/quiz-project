# quiz-project
Quiz project using HTML, CSS and Javascript.

For this project, I used fundamental HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build a quiz application. This application will be able to load questions from a 3rd party API, track and display high scores.

Some of the topics covered are:

• Save high scores in Local Storage

• Create a progress bar

• Create a spinning loader icon

• Dynamically generate HTML in JavaScript

• Fetch trivia questions from Open Trivia DB API

• JavaScript - Array Functions (splice, map, sort), Local Storage, Fetch API

• ES6 JavaScript Features - Arrow Functions, the Spread Operator, Template Literals

• CSS - Flexbox, and Animations
